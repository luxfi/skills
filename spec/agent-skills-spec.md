# Agent Skills Specification

This repository follows the [Agent Skills specification](https://agentskills.io/specification).

Each skill is defined by a `SKILL.md` file containing:
- YAML frontmatter with metadata (name, description, requirements)
- Markdown body with usage instructions, endpoints, and examples

Skills are compatible with any agent framework that supports the Agent Skills spec, including:
- [Hanzo Bot](https://hanzo.bot) (`npx @hanzo/bot`)
- Claude Code
- Codex
- Cursor
- Openclaw
